## Basic plots

### Histogram comparison
Some classes are provided to facilitate making plots in CMS style.
If you have a list of histograms, `hists`, you want to compare with a ratio plot,
use the [`Plot`](python/plot/Plot.py) class, e.g.
```
from TauFW.Plotter.plot.Plot import Plot, CMSStyle
CMSStyle.setCMSEra(2018)
plot = Plot("x",hists)
plot.draw(ratio=True,grid=True,logy=True)
plot.drawlegend()
plot.saveas("plot.png")
plots.close()
```

  <img src="../docs/testHists_ratio_logy.png" alt="Gaussians with Plot class and ratio plot" width="420"/>
</p>

### Data-MC comparison
If you want to make a data-MC comparison between a data histogram `datahist` and
a list of expected SM processes, `exphists`,
you can use the [`Stack`](python/plot/Stack.py) class, with something like
```
from TauFW.Plotter.plot.Stack import Stack, CMSStyle
CMSStyle.setCMSEra(2018)
plot = Stack("p_{T} [GeV]",datahist,exphists)
plot.draw(ratio=True,logy=False)
plot.drawlegend(pos='right')
plot.drawtext("#mu#tau_{h} baseline")
plot.saveas("stack.png")
plot.saveas("stack.pdf")
plots.close()
```

### Single 2D histograms
You can create 2D histograms using the [`Plot2D`](python/plot/Plot2D.py) class, e.g.
```
from TauFW.Plotter.plot.Plot2D import Plot2D
CMSStyle.setCMSEra(2018)
plot = Plot2D("x","y",hist)
plot.draw(logz=True,ztitle="Events")
plot.drawlegend()
plot.drawtext("#mu#tau_{h} baseline")
plot.drawprofile('x')
plot.saveas("plot2D.png")
plots.close()
```


### Examples
Simple examples of usage of `Plot` and `Stack` are provided in [`test/`](test/), run as
```
test/testPlot.py -v2
test/testStack.py -v2
```

</p>


### CMS style
[`CMSStyle.py`](python/plot/CMSStyle.py) provides tools to make a plot have the CMS style.
The luminosity and center-of-mass energy are automatically set for a given year,
```
CMSStyle.setCMSEra(2018)
```
but can be manually set as
```
CMSStyle.setCMSEra(2018,lumi=59.7,cme=13,extra="Preliminary")
```
To change the default values, you can directly edit the hardcoded dictionaries:
```
import TauFW.Plotter.plot.CMSStyle as CMSStyle
CMSStyle.lumi_dict['UL2018'] = 59.8
CMSStyle.era_dict['UL2018'] = "2018"
```


## Variable
A [`Variable`](python/plot/Variable.py) class is provided to contain variable name (e.g. `pt_1`),
title (e.g. `Leading p_{T} [GeV]`) and the binning (`nbins,xmin,xmax` or a list of bins edges), for example:
```
from TauFW.Plotter.plot.Variable import Variable
variables = [
  Variable('pt_1',  "p_{T}",   40, 0,200),
  Variable('m_vis', "m_{vis}", [0,20,40,50,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,100,120,150]),
  Variable('njets', "Number of jets", 8, 0,  8),
  Variable('nbtag', "Number of b jets", 8, 0,  8, weight="btagweight"),
  Variable('pt_1+pt_2+jpt_1', "S_{T}", 40, 0, 800, cut="jpt_1>50", fname="ST"),
]
```
A `Variable` object can contain a lot of information, passed as key-word arguments that are
useful when making plots (e.g. `ymin`, `ymax`, `logx`, `logy`, `ymargin`, ...)
or selection strings (e.g. `cut`, `blind`, `weight`, ...).
It also has several handy functions that provide shortcuts for common routines.
For example, `Variable.gethist` can create a histogram for you:
```
hist = var.gethist()
```
and `Variable.drawcmd` can parse a draw command for [`TTree::Draw`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html#a73450649dc6e54b5b94516c468523e45):
```
var  = Variable('pt_1',40,0,200)
hist = var.gethist('hist') # returns a TH1D with name 'hist'
dcmd = var.drawcmd('hist') # returns a string, e.g. "pt_1 >> hist"
tree.Draw(dcmd)            # loops over tree events and fills the histogram 'hist'
```
It can also be used to initialize a `Plot`, `Plot2D`, or `Stack` object, e.g.
```
xvar = Variable('pt_1',40,0,200,logy=True,ymargin=1.4)
yvar = Variable('pt_1',40,0,200,logy=True,ymargin=1.4)
plot = Plot(xvar,hists)
plot2D = Plot2D(xvar,yvar,hist2D)
```
Examples are provided in [`test/testVariables.py`](test/testVariables.py).

### Context
Often, plots need to be adjusted for different selections.
You might need a larger range at higher energies, or a wider binning for fewer events.
To avoid cluttering code with a bunch of if statements. the `Variable` class offers a way
to change things like the binning, title, extra cuts, etc. on the context.
The context can be triggered by a set of strings.
To change the binning, specify the context for example the `cbin` option:
```
var = Variable('pt_1',"pt",40,0,200,cbin={'nbtag>=1':(50,0,500)}),
for sel in ["pt_1>30","pt_1>50 && nbtag>=1"]:
  var.changecontext(sel)  # check if string matches a predefined context
  hist = var.gethist()    # binning will depend on the context
```
Here, `cbin` is a dictionary whose keys are regular expression that are matched to strings passed
to `Variable.changecontext`. If the string matches a predefined key (`'nbtag>=1'` in the case above),
the associated binning is used.
If there are multiple keys, they are ordered by length, from most to least number of characters.
The longest strings that matches will be used.

Similarly, one can change the title using `ctitle`, e.g.
```
var = Variable('pt_1',"Muon pt",40,0,200,ctitle={'etau':"Electron pt",'tautau':"Tau pt"}),
for channel in channels:
  for sel in selections:
     var.changecontext(channel,sel)
```

To see how this works in action, please play around with [`test/testVariables.py`](test/testVariables.py).


## Sample
A [`Sample`](python/sample/Sample.py) class is provided to contain and interface your analysis ntuples (`pico`).
It keeps track of a sample's information like title (for legends), filename, cross section, normalization, etc.
To initialize, you need to pass a unique name, a title (for legends) and a filename:
```
sample = Sample("TT","t#bar{t}","TT_mutau.root",831.76)
```
The fourth argument can be a float that is the cross section (in units of pb).
It will be used by `Sample.normalize` to compute the normalization to the integrated luminosity times cross section as
```
norm = lumi*xsec*1000/sumw
```
if the total sum of weights, `sumw`, of all MC samples is given, otherwise the total number of MC events `nevts` is used.
The total number of events and total sum of weights will automatically be taken from the
[`'cutflow'` histogram](../PicoProducer/python/analysis/#Cutflow) if it exists,
otherwise, the user should pass it directly with `nevts` or `sumw`:
```
sample = Sample("TT,"t#bar{t}","TT_mutau.root",831.76,nevts=76915549,lumi=59.7)
```
Instead of passing the integrated luminosity with `lumi` (in units of inverse fb) to `Sample`, you can set it globally
in [`python/sample/utils.py`](python/sample/utils.py) by passing the era like this:
```
from TauFW.Plotter.sample.utils import setera
setera(2018)
```
This will also immediately set the era for plots via `CMSStyle`. To set the era manually,
directly edit the dictionary `lumi_dict` in the `python/sample/utils.py`, or use
```
setera(2018,59.7)
```

### Creating histograms
`Sample` provides a useful method that can create and fill a histogram (`TH1D`) for some variable.
It can be called in several ways:
```
var  = Variable('m_vis',40,0,200)
hist = sample.gethist('m_vis',40,0,200,"pt_1>30 && pt_2>30")
hist = sample.gethist('m_vis',[0,40,50,60,70,90,100,120,200],"pt_1>30 && pt_2>30")
hist = sample.gethist(var,"pt_1>30 && pt_2>30")
```
To speed up things, it can create histograms in parallel with [`MultiDraw`](python/plot/MultiDraw.py):
```
vars = [
  Variable('m_vis', 40,0,200),
  Variable('nbtags', 8,0,  8, weight="btagweight"),
  Variable('jpt_1', 40,0,200, cut="abs(jeta_1)<2.5", title="Forward jet pt"),
]
hists = sample.gethist(vars,"pt_1>30 && pt_2>30")
```
where `vars` is a list of variables as above, and the returned `hists` is a list of `TH1D`s.
Similarly, `Sample.gethist2D` is available for 2D histograms (`TH2D`).
With `Variable` objects, you can include extra cuts or weights that are variable-specific.
In the example above, the `btagweight` weight will only be applied to `nbtags`,
and the `jpt_1>0` cut only to `jpt_1`.

### Splitting
You can also split samples into different components (e.g. real/misidentified, or decay mode)
based on some cuts. e.g.
```
sample.split(('ZTT',"Real tau","genmatch_2==5"),
             ('ZJ', "Fake tau","genmatch_2!=5"))
hists = { }
for subsample in sample.splitsamples:
  hists[subsample] = subsample.gethist(vars,"pt_1>50")
```
Each component is defined by a unique name (e.g. `'ZTT'` and `'ZJ'`), a title `"Real tau"`, and a cut,
which must be orthogonal to the others to avoid overlap.
Examples are provided in [`test/testSamples.py`](test/testSamples.py):
```
test/testSamples.py -v2
```

### Sample style
The color and title style is predefined by dictionaries in [`python/sample/SampleStyle.py`](python/sample/SampleStyle.py).
These dictionaries are used to automatically set the color for `Sample` object if none is passed.
You can change the default sample colors and title to your preference as
```
import TauFW.Plotter.sample.SampleStyle as STYLE
STYLE.sample_colors['ZTT'] = kOrange-4
STYLE.sample_titles['ZTT'] = "Z -> #tau#tau
```
Some string patterns for axis titles and legend entries are automatically converted to LaTeX format
by [`makelatex` in `python/plot/string.py`](python/plot/string.py). To disable this, pass the `latex=False`
option to the `Plot.draw`, `Plot.drawlegend` and , `Plot.drawtext` functions.

  <img src="../docs/testStyle_legend_DMs.png" alt="Legend with Z -> tautau split into decay modes" width="200"/>
</p>


## Sample set
The [`SampleSet`](python/sample/SampleSet.py) class helps to contain data and MC `Samples` objects:
```
from TauFW.Plotter.sample.SampleSet import SampleSet
samples = SampleSet(datasample,expsamples)
samples.printtable()
```
Here, `datasample` is a single `Sample` object of observed data,
while `expsamples` is a simple python list of `Sample` objects wrapping MC ntuples.

### Initialization via table
To make initialization of sample sets of `pico` ntuples easier,
you can use the help function [`getsampleset`](python/sample/utils.py), for example:
```
expsamples = [ # table of MC samples to be converted to Sample objects
  ('DY', "DYJetsToLL_M-10to50",  "Drell-Yan 10-50", 18610.0, {'extraweight': 'zptweight'} ),
  ('WJ', "WJetsToLNu",           "W + jets",        50260.0, ),
  ('TT', "TT",                   "ttbar",             831.76 ),
]
datasamples = ('Data', "SingleMuon_Run2016?", "Observed") # to be converted to Sample object
sampleset = getsampleset(datasamples,expsamples,era=2016)
```
Here, `expsamples` is a list of python tuples:
```
  ( GROUP, SAMPLE, TITLE, XSEC )
```
To pass special options via keywords, use an extra dictionary.
Here, group name `GROUP` and sample name `SAMPLE` correspond to what was used during [`pico` production](../PicoProducer#Samples).
Data is a single tuple:
```
  ( GROUP, SAMPLE, TITLE )
```
Here, `SAMPLE` should be the data set name (e.g. `SingleMuon_Run2016`) corresponding to a single `pico` file
(e.g. `SingleMuon_Run2016_mutau.root`) containing processed events of the whole data period,
or it can be a pattern (e.g. `SingleMuon_Run2016?`) for multiple files
(e.g. `SingleMuon_Run2016B_mutau.root`, `SingleMuon_Run2016C_mutau.root`, ...) 

By default, `getsampleset` will automatically assume the samples can be found via the pattern
```
"$PICODIR/$SAMPLE_$CHANNEL.root"
```
where `PICODIR` will be retrieved from the [`PicoProducer` config file](../PicoProducer#Configuration).
You can instead specify to `getsampleset` the file name pattern with the keyword `file`.
With the keyword option `url` you can pass a `XRootD` url that will be prepended to this pattern.

To get an overview of the samples, use
```
sampleset.printtable()
>>> Samples with integrated luminosity L = 35.9 / fb at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV
>>> Sample name                title                      xsec [pb]      nevents    sumweights      norm  weight

```
The luminosity-cross section normalization is given by the `norm` column, which is [described above](#Sample).

A full example is given in [`test/plotPico.py`](test/plotPico.py).
This script assumes a complete list of 2016 `pico` ntuples in the [`mutau` channel](../PicoProducer/python/analysis/ModuleMuTau.py).

### Joining samples
Sometimes you want to group samples into one bigger merged sample,
to reduce the number of backgrounds on your plots, or treat them as one in a fit.
This can be done with by using the [`MergedSample`](python/sample/MergedSample.py) class,
but `SampleSet` provides a help function that does it for you, for example,
```
sampleset.join('DY',               name='DY', title="Drell-Yan"           )
sampleset.join('VV','WZ','WW','ZZ',name='VV', title="Diboson"             )
sampleset.join('TT','ST',          name='Top',title="ttbar and single top")
```
The name and (legend) title of the merged sample is passed by the keyword arguments `name` and `title`.
The first string arguments are different search terms or glob patterns (with `*` wildcards) that can be used to identify the samples you want to merge.

### Stitching samples
In the TauPOG, typically "jet-binned" samples of Drell-Yan (Z+jets) and W+jets are used,
like `DY[1-4]JetsToLL_M-50*` or `W[1-4]JetsToLNu*`. (Here "jet" means number of LHE-level partons.)
They increase the statistics, but overlap with their respective jet-inclusive sample.
Therefore a special "stitching" procedure is needed that changes the effective
luminosity-cross section normalization per "jet-bin", before they are merged into one big sample.
The method is explained [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/MCStitching|on this TWiki page]].

You can use the [`stitch` help function](python/sample/utils.py) to do it automatically:
```
sampleset.stitch("W*Jets",   incl='WJ', name='WJ'                               )
sampleset.stitch("DY*J*M-50",incl='DYJ',name="DY_M-50",title="Drell-Yan M=50GeV")
```
Again, the first strings arguments are search terms or patterns to identify the samples you want to stitch together.
The keyword argument `incl` is the search term to identify the inclusive samples (e.g. `DYJetsToLL_M-50` or `WJetsToLNu`).
As per HTT convention, the branch variable name that indicates the number of partons ("jets") is called `NUP`.
This variable corresponds to [`LHE_Njets` in nanoAOD](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/plugins/LHETablesProducer.cc).

To understand how the normalization is computed, look in [`python/sample/utils.py`](python/sample/utils.py),
and pass `stitch` the option `verbosity=2` to printout a table.

The k-factor is computed on the fly. You can set the (N)NLO cross section via the `xsec` keyword,
or by changing the hardcoded `xsecs_nlo` dictionary in `utils.py`.

In the end, after merging and stitching, you might obtain something a summary table like this:
```
sampleset.printtable()
>>> Samples with integrated luminosity L = 35.9 / fb at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV
>>> Sample name                title                      xsec [pb]      nevents    sumweights      norm  weight

This is the output of the full example given in [`test/plotPico.py`](test/plotPico.py).
This script assumes a complete list of 2016 `pico` ntuples in the [`mutau` channel](../PicoProducer/python/analysis/ModuleMuTau.py).

### Splitting samples
Like described [above](#Sample), you can split samples via `SampleSet`:
```
sampleset.split('DY',[
  ('ZTT',"Z -> tau_{#mu}tau_{h}",      "genmatch_2==5"),
  ('ZL', "Drell-Yan with l -> tau_{h}","genmatch_2>0 && genmatch_2<5"),
  ('ZJ', "Drell-Yan with j -> tau_{h}","genmatch_2==0")
])
```

### Data/MC plots
The `SampleSet` class can create and fill histograms for you:
```
result = samples.gethists(var,selection)
print result.var                 # Variable
print result.data                # TH1D
print result.exp                 # list of TH1Ds
var, datahist, exphists = result # Variable, TH1D, list
```
Or with `MultiDraw` for many variables:
```
result = samples.gethists(vars,selection)
print result.vars                # list of Variable
print result.data                # dictionary of Variable object to TH1D
print result.exp                 # dictionary of Variable object to list of TH1Ds
for var, datahist, exphists in result:
  print var, datahist, exphists  # Variable, TH1D, list
```
Here, `result` is a [`HistSet`](python/sample/HistSet.py) object, which contains a list of `Variable` objects,
and dictionaries for data and MC histograms.

Alternatively, you can immediately prepare the histograms into a `Stack` plot:
```
stacks = samples.getstack(variables,selection)
for stack in stacks:
  stack.draw()
  stack.drawlegend()
  stack.saveas()
  stack.close()
```
Examples are provided in `test/testSamples.py`.

### Data-driven methods
Data-driven background methods like QCD or j → 𝜏<sub>h</sub> fake estimation can be added as plug-ins
in [`python/methods/`](python/methods/). A python file should contain a function of the same name,
e.g. for the [`QCD_OSSS.py`](python/methods/QCD_OSSS.py) example:
```
from TauFW.Plotter.sample.SampleSet import SampleSet
def QCD_OSSS(self, variables, selection, **kwargs):
  ...
  return qcdhists
SampleSet.QCD_OSSS = QCD_OSSS # add as class method of SampleSet
```
The method returns a list of `TH1` histograms that correspond one-to-one to the list of `variables`.
These histograms are subsequently inserted in the list of MC histograms.

To use them, specify the method name when using `SampleSet.getstack` or `SampleSet.gethists`:
```
stacks = samples.getstack(variables,selection,method='QCD_OSSS')
```
This will load the file and make the method available.
You can set the position of the new histogram in the stack via `imethod`,
where `0` means on the top, and `-1` means on the bottom.


## Plotting script

### Stacked data-MC
An example of a plotting script for data/MC comparisions is given by [`plot.py`](plot.py).
It can be run for a given channel and era as
```
./plot.py -c mutau -y 2018
```
It will load a `SampleSet` from `config/samples.py` as a function of a channel and era.
By default the script will look for pico samples in `$PICODIR`, specified in the `PicoProducer` config.
You can edit the scripts  and this config file to your specifications and liking.

### 2D histograms
An example of a 2D plotting script is given by [`plot2D.py`](plot2D.py).
It creates 2D histograms for a specified samples. The samples are defined in `config/samples.py`.
Edit the desired variable pairs and selections in the script, and run for example as
```
./plot2D.py -c mutau -y 2018 -s DY
```


## Macros

Several macros with help functions are provided in [`python/macros/`](python/macros).
Their functions can be loaded using `ROOT` directly, e.g.
```
from ROOT import gROOT
gROOT.ProcessLine(".L python/macros/tauIDSF.C+O")
```
or via the help function `loadmacro` as
```
from TauFW.Plotter.sample.utils import loadmacro
loadmacro("python/macros/tauIDSF.C")
```
After that, it can be imported from ROOT
```
from ROOT import loadTauIDSF, getTauIDSF
loadTauIDSF("sfs.root",'Medium')
sf = getTauIDSF(dm,genmatch)
```
or used as in variable, selection or weight expressions
in `TTree::Draw` or `TTree::MultiDraw` (including via `Sample.gethist`).
Some examples of usage are shown in [`test/testMacros.py`](test/testMacros.py).
